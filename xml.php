<p>DHARAMSHALA: Mr. Tashi Phuntsok, the Secretary for Information of the Department of Information and International Relations (DIIR), Central Tibetan Administration, met with a group of visitors from South Africa at DIIR hall today.</p>
<p>The Secretary began the session with a brief introduction of the Tibet issue beginning with the occupation of Tibet by China in 1949 and the subsequent flight of His Holiness the Dalai Lama into exile followed by thousands of Tibetans. He also apprised the group about the establishment of the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA); to restore freedom for Tibetans, to look after the welfare of Tibetans in exile and promote the Tibet issue across the globe.</p>
<p>He explained the structure of the CTA; the three pillars of democracy; Kashag, Judiciary (Executive) and Legislature and the policies framed by it. Explaining in detail the seven departments of CTA and the 12 Offices of Tibet across the world, the Secretary said that services provided by the CTA reach the grass-root level of all Tibetan communities around the world.</p>
<p>“CTA is able to not only provide the political impetus for Tibetan struggle, not only the preservation of Tibetan culture, but also to look after the welfare of Tibetans all over the world through democracy and modern education,” he said.</p>
<p>He also mentioned a blend of modernity and tradition in the composition of the Tibetan Parliament-in-Exile. “It consists of 44 members with 10 representatives each from the three traditional provinces of Tibet, 2 each from the four schools of Tibetan Buddhism and Bon religion and two each from Tibetan communities in North America and Europe” he said.</p>
<p>“Through all these efforts, we manage to keep alive the Tibet issue, voice the condition of Tibetan people in Tibet around the world. The situation of Tibet is deplorable and very tragic; nearly around 140 Tibetans have self-immolated. The whole thing about self-immolation is because the situation in Tibet is so grave that they don’t find any avenue to express themselves and they find it extremely difficult to live under China in that frustrating and suffocating repressive situation” he concluded, leaving the floor open for Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>Mr. Klasie Wessels, Director of Street School in South Africa, initiated the program in 2012. It was initially intended for personality development and learning different culture, which later altered to ‘learning the Tibetan situation’, and it was the 11<sup>th</sup> group to visit Dharamshala u<strong>n</strong>der the program.</p>

<p>Leura, Blue Mountains, NSW, Australia, <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_602230253"><span class="aQJ">4 June 2015 <a href="http://dalailama.com">Dalailama.com</a></span></span></p>
<p>The Delhi roads were wet with rain and the air was clearer and cooler than in recent days as His Holiness the Dalai Lama left for the airport yesterday morning to travel to Australia. After a smooth flight to Singapore, he was met on arrival by representatives of the Indian High Commission. After a short stopover he flew on through the night to Sydney, arriving just before dawn. Again representatives of the Indian High Commission and his hosts ‘Dalai Lama in Australia’ were on hand to receive him as he left the plane. Members of the public greeted him with evident joy as he walked through the airport.</p>
<p>His Holiness gave a brief interview to Waleed Aly, co-host of Network Ten&#8217;s news and current affairs television program ‘The Project’. Aly congratulated him on completing his 80th year and asked what he does on his birthday.</p>
<p>“Last month I had a party with Archbishop Desmond Tutu at the Tibetan Children’s Village in Dharamsala.” His Holiness told him. “They’d made a cake and he taught me how to blow out the candles. But generally for a Buddhist your birthday isn’t that significant. Using your time in a meaningful way is more important.”</p>
<p>When Aly expressed an assumption that His Holiness has already achieved nirvana, he exclaimed:</p>
<p>“No, no, there are higher bodhisattvas who no longer suffer due to their own karma, but I haven’t reached that yet. For instance, I still lose my temper.”</p>
<p>And when Aly pressed him to explain when that happens, His Holiness jokingly replied:</p>
<p>“If you ask a silly question.”</p>
<div id="attachment_75960" style="width: 549px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://tibet.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2015-06-04-Leura-G03.jpg" class="jackbox cta_post_image" style="display:block" data-group="images" data-thumbnail="http://tibet.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2015-06-04-Leura-G03.jpg" >

<p>Aly wanted to know what the point of religion is in today’s world and His Holiness told him that religion is an instrument for training our minds and bringing about inner peace. He pointed out that all the major religious traditions talk about love, compassion and forgiveness. He remarked that contrary to some people’s preconceptions, anger and hatred are signs of weakness, whereas inner peace is a sign of strength. He added that belief in God can be a powerful source of inner peace. However, when 1 billion of the 7 billion human beings alive today have no religious belief, the important thing to remember is our common goal is to be good human beings. As social animals we need to express love and affection for each other.</p>
<p>Asked how this applied to those who don’t deserve respect, to extremely violent groups like ISIS or ISIL, His Holiness agreed that the situation is very difficult to handle because such people are already in the grip of extremely negative emotions. But he stressed that we need to accept the need to train future generations in secular ethics and humane values based on our common experiences and scientific findings to prevent the eruption of such emotions in the future. When pressed about whether this meant adopting a course of inaction, His Holiness explained that the trouble with using violence is that it inevitably leads to more violence. He stressed that somehow we need to talk to these people, to ask them why they have such strong anger and fear.</p>
<p>When Aly asked if he would consider giving advice to Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, His Holiness laughed and said one of the Prime Minister’s main concerns would be with the economy and that’s something he knows nothing about. But he stressed the urgent need to for economic development to help the poor everywhere, citing the sad news that 2000 people have recently died in the heat wave sweeping India.</p>
<p>“These were poor people; people with no facilities. We have to develop the economy in order to improve the situation for people like that.”</p>
<p>About 200 Tibetans had gathered in the airport lobby to greet His Holiness as emerged. He was given a traditional welcome and offered the ‘Chema Changpu’. He exchanged words and shook hands with many old friends as he made his way to the door. Under a brilliant blue sky he climbed into a car for the hour and a half journey to the Blue Mountains. On arrival in Leura, about 150 Tibetans, many in traditional costume, carrying flags and banners, and others who have come to attend the teachings he is due to give, were gathered to give him a warm welcome.</p>
<p><span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_602230254"><span class="aQJ">Tomorrow</span></span> will see the start of five days of teachings related to Guhyasamaja, beginning with a Vajrabhairava empowerment.</p>

<p>DHARAMSHALA: Following Kalon Ngodup Tsering and SARD Secretary Ngodup Dorjee’s damage assessment visit to quake affected areas in Nepal, the Kashag of the Central Tibetan Administration led by Sikyong Dr. Lobsang Sangay, took the step to provide an additional NPR 3 Crores as relief for Tibetans in Nepal.</p>
<p>The funds are raised through the Central Tibetan Administration’s emergency relief and rehabilitation fund-raising campaign in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake. 50% of the fund is raised from within the Tibetan community in India and abroad through its offices of Tibet and settlement officers. The other half of the fund is raised from the CTA’s network of donors and supporters across the world.</p>
<p>As in any natural calamity, the CTA’s response towards the earthquake was based on the three-phased approach: rescue, relief and reconstruction.</p>
<p>In the first phase, the Central Tibetan Administration sanctioned NPR 5.6 Million for the Tibetans in Nepal through the earthquake relief committee based in Kathmandu. 16 Lacs from the amount has been utilised for rescuing as well as treatment of those injured in the quake including NPR 50,000 for each of the 13 victims. Almost 40 Lacs from the fund were distributed in cash to Tibetans for basic amenities and contingency.</p>
<p>The second phase of Interim Relief is currently undergoing. Interim relief is imperative at the moment due to the onset of monsoon, which could result in outbreaks of serious illness and other unforeseen issues.</p>
<p>The third and final phase would be the reconstruction of the buildings, houses and other social and economic facilities damaged by the quake. The reconstruction is expected to begin between the next 3 – 6 months depending on the availability of funds.</p>
<p>The NPR 30 Million relief money is allocated as below:</p>
<p>i) Ex gratia payment of NPR 2 Lac for each member of a family who has died in the earthquake, with a total allocation of NPR 26,00,00.</p>
<p>ii) An additional allowance of NPR 3000 per person for six months for those categorised as Below Poverty Line (Nyamthak), with a totyal allocation of NPR 25,02,000.</p>
<p>iii) Temporary shelter of GI sheets for those whose houses have been destroyed, with a total allocation of NPR 14,80,000.</p>
<p>iv) Renovation of minor damages to homes, offices, and community buildings as per the list provided by the settlement officers and assessed by the two-member Kashag’s delegation. Total amount allocated 46,00,000.</p>
<p>v) Special ex gratia payments to Bakhang and Thupten Choeling nunneries with a total allocation of NPR 30,00,000</p>
<p>vi) Renovation of Schools Buildings: Namgyal High School; Namgyal Middle School; Songtsen High School; Atisha School; Lekshed Tsal; Mt. Kailash School and Shar Khumbu School;  and for arranging temporary classrooms with a total allocation of NRs. 87,00,000/-</p>
<p>vii) A total of NPR 25,50,000 has been provided for health care including medicines, and sanitation as per the list with a total allocation of NPR 25,50,000.</p>
<p>viii) NPR 45,68,000 has been allocated for administration and contingency including logistics.</p>
<p>The Kashag has directed the offices of Tibet and settlement officers to send the money to Nepal and some have already initiated the process. It is hoped that the entire amount would be sent by the end of this month.</p>
<p>Expressing his profound sympathies with the suffering and situation in Nepal, Sikyong Dr. Lobsang Sangay, the democratically-elected political head of the Tibetan people, said: “ Sadly, there have been some Tibetan deaths both in Nepal and across the border in Tibet. Severe damages to life and property have also been caused as a result of the earthquake. We pray for them and urge them to maintain their perseverance and resilience in facing this tragedy.”</p>
<p>The Central Tibetan Administration also applauded the Tibetan community across Nepal led by Buddhist monks and nuns for their relentless relief efforts in helping the victims of the earthquake in remote places and terrain in Nepal. “It is a reflection of the inherent kindness and gratitude of Tibetans towards Nepali people as adviced by His Holiness the Dalai Lama,” Sikyong added.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p><strong><span lang="EN-US">With China challenging the U.S.-led regional framework in Asia, Americans are being forced to reconsider long-standing assumptions.</span></strong></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">By Robert Manning, 21 May 2015, National Interest.Org<br />
</span></p>
<p>In recent weeks a tsunami of papers, reports and articles have surfaced calling for a rethinking of U.S. policy toward China. They veer in all policy directions from reconciling differences and forming an Asia-Pacific community, to containment and confrontation. But they all reflect a troubling epiphany that has seized attention from policy-watchers: core assumptions that have guided a bipartisan China policy for eight presidencies, from Nixon to Obama are unraveling. One prominent China scholar has even boldly pronounced that<a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001Yzw48hWOHfIIt42rrJU0ykLro7CDToCnbXsqRM3YTHyzsaOKykzUZv-9Yh1SxYMQ-DiT8os7ahq3k_jSbWwAPsvxaDq8nxRbccUPCsznYmJLmipaNW1KwUmlbBQsmJ2bsNjk05ChlGD3V7GElQSc5FrKu4T3fkCnYn5hkIsrK_YKRCdSBFo1mkTW6NNuglokwxlI9iq7U_f9O73ffiOGdBlpteCrsTxyfTlawbq5944=&amp;c=e4FdTaKuA4e2834lyR9gs4og1f4YQLqbuPrEoMTtdHW9f5PJfq833g==&amp;ch=ZrfR0Jw8GHObRaQ7uSpKhSzRRS1O6A1j5BnBw88eWuVsAW_fIobnCQ=="><u> we are witnessing is</u></a> [4] &#8220;the beginning of the end of the Chinese Communist Party.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though the Nixon opening was a strategic counter to the USSR, as China reformed and modernized its economy post-1979, U.S. policy has assumed that as a Chinese middle class grew, political reform, if not democratization would follow. This has been the case across Asia over the past three decades-in the Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan, Mongolia, Thailand and Indonesia. It may eventually occur-China is, by several orders of magnitude larger than other Asian democratized states with a 3,000-year-old culture-but in its own way and on its own timeline. For now, the Communist Party has tightened political control.</p>
<p>A related assumption has been that as China integrated itself into the globalized economic and political system, Beijing, which has been a principal beneficiary of the U.S.-led system, would see its interests best served by being a &#8220;responsible stakeholder&#8221; in that system, one that would not be static, but adapt to new economic realities. When then Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick, a realist, raised this idea in 2005, it was a reasonable notion &#8212; China&#8217;s economy was five times smaller than it is now ($10.3 trillion in 2014.)</p>
<p>A variant is the &#8220;liberal institutionalist&#8221; school of international relations theory which assumes, as one leading scholar<a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001Yzw48hWOHfIIt42rrJU0ykLro7CDToCnbXsqRM3YTHyzsaOKykzUZv-9Yh1SxYMQWwerpvpEW-CsHzKwIiB__udC6yQe4KbHlzPu_velwuzwLg7gxO67FKmwtLIBTxQ4I3Ahe_vrTIqmFLcL7aOmJHx0NQ-Vodr-fsLAMoCAz9JhVNFfOqr_5RbwbrIWNU56JzE6Te35RibcV5x0nrmfyyITFeaEIbRnYvlGJNr7UtvdAp6vKmRneBW0Z73dqZAA&amp;c=e4FdTaKuA4e2834lyR9gs4og1f4YQLqbuPrEoMTtdHW9f5PJfq833g==&amp;ch=ZrfR0Jw8GHObRaQ7uSpKhSzRRS1O6A1j5BnBw88eWuVsAW_fIobnCQ=="><u> has written</u></a> [6], that, &#8220;unlike the imperial system of the past, the Western order is built around rules and norms of nondiscrimination and market openness, creating conditions for rising states to advance their expanding economic and political goals within it.</p>
<p>This argument might be partially true if the Bretton Woods institutions were not so inert and reformed to adapt to new economic realities. However, Beijing&#8217;s launch of the AIIB, one of a score of parallel economic and political/security institutions that China is pursuing as a hedging strategy, points to the shortcomings of this view. Even if it is integrated or not, why would Beijing simply accept rules it didn&#8217;t write? It shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise that China acts like a great power, and seeks to skew the system to serve its interests?</p>
<p><strong>Wither China Policy?</strong></p>
<p>The realization that things are not going as the United States expected is leading many in the policy community to frantically cast about for an alternative China strategy. One recent entry into the China policy sweepstakes was a piece in the<a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001Yzw48hWOHfIIt42rrJU0ykLro7CDToCnbXsqRM3YTHyzsaOKykzUZv-9Yh1SxYMQqgRqrF_tJbl_uMJktC3WedMT_LI2RdNKsDqgQ-7gzMPT0hxM6yhYFZZ1jmwetHJ2X6oobo9-vk5PbUzcwH52bSdvCDbNK4UX8Zh9MGAzKkOnxGXOcSna-K1Ch_kpsFrqVGRqfO_0RXW2yN4H7zIjgfHWOrBh75Qq1oa3ZgPnm9QSfH4Oi7vM3PhcvLSRriJy&amp;c=e4FdTaKuA4e2834lyR9gs4og1f4YQLqbuPrEoMTtdHW9f5PJfq833g==&amp;ch=ZrfR0Jw8GHObRaQ7uSpKhSzRRS1O6A1j5BnBw88eWuVsAW_fIobnCQ=="><u> Weekly Standard proposing</u></a> [7] a &#8220;new&#8221; China strategy-Democracy promotion with explicit support for anti-regime elements. This tends to be the default neocon approach to most unpleasant regimes. Never mind that it is littered with failures. Why let reality get in the way of an ideologically satisfying theory?</p>
<p>In the case of China, it is a textbook example of what not to do, and would likely be spectacularly unsuccessful. First, it would reinforce Beijing&#8217;s victim narrative: that the United States seeks to undermine its rise. Second, it is ahistorical, ignoring the U.S. policy experience in Asia over the past thirty years, an approach with impressive democratization results.</p>
<p>With the U.S. alliance system and forward deployed presence underpinning a stable East Asian security environment, relatively open markets, investments and aid, U.S. policy helped enable the Asian economic miracle. Successful export-led growth in turn propelled first Japan, then the &#8220;Asian Tigers (South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong) to take off, followed by other ASEAN states.</p>
<p>In the Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan, Mongolia, Thailand, and Indonesia, political transformations occurred organically when the situation was ripe in each instance. The United States did not seek to be the &#8220;invisible hand&#8221; guiding these processes, and either had no direct role or, in the cases of the Philippines and South Korea, gave well-timed 11th hour nudges that helped tip the balance. In no case did the United States ostentatiously employ democracy promotion to fast-forward history as a leading policy tool.</p>
<p>In the case of China, the United States has (and should) raise human rights and seek to ameliorate Chinese transgressions. But to lead U.S. policy with emphasis on democracy (aka regime change) would result in more repression from a paranoid and insecure CCP, with dissident voices targeted. In a complex, multidimensional Sino-American relationship, it would almost certainly make China less cooperative in other aspects of the relationship.</p>
<p>Moreover, in making its case, the <em>Weekly Standard</em> piece engages in fanciful historical revisionism, criticizing the Bush administration for not compelling Beijing to change its policies during the 1989 Tiananmen Square uprising. This is a case of grossly overestimating U.S. leverage. Serving in the State Department&#8217;s East Asia bureau at the time, I recall the quashed hopes and frustration of the administration. Secret trips by then-Deputy Secretary of State Larry Eagleburger and NSC advisor Brent Scowcroft weathered criticism at the time, but sought to prevent things from spinning out of control. But I recall we were all-too aware of the limits of U.S. influence on the CCP.</p>
<p>But there are two even larger concerns about this idea, which plays to the deeply ingrained U.S. missionary impulse. One is the fantasy that a democratic China would &#8220;be like us,&#8221; rather than a nationalist rising power that like other major powers, would seek to bend the system to serve its interests; second is a seeming lack of confidence in our values. Do we have so little faith in the &#8220;soft power&#8221; of their universality that we have to impose them on others?</p>
<p><strong>Yellow Submarine or Containment</strong></p>
<p>Other entrants into the new Kennan sweepstakes have ranged from former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd to the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), recommending efforts from mysteriously working through differences and living happily ever after in an Asia-Pacific community on the one hand, to fashioning a new containment &#8220;grand strategy&#8221; on the other. That these are the conclusions of two major reports, both released in April, suggest the intellectual and political elite see U.S.-China policy is in dire need of rethinking.</p>
<p>Rudd calls for a &#8220;<a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001Yzw48hWOHfIIt42rrJU0ykLro7CDToCnbXsqRM3YTHyzsaOKykzUZv-9Yh1SxYMQLlBeiS_SRQh4Cs4TNvCefXgrj3n-1gSuDJ0OBrFGbfs18Ju4kf6cepGjllIFt3snIxOqoo-llPr19Ky2-LBOO4gQxYOJ_UutV-KScZQaLt4iSv6sLPcM_DxE09j7y44z7khBS-s1yFJbHk5i13MX8h_raH3FwfUgd0aX1RJ6ud2paWBqDpIXrg==&amp;c=e4FdTaKuA4e2834lyR9gs4og1f4YQLqbuPrEoMTtdHW9f5PJfq833g==&amp;ch=ZrfR0Jw8GHObRaQ7uSpKhSzRRS1O6A1j5BnBw88eWuVsAW_fIobnCQ=="><u>New Framework of Constructive Realism for Common Purpose</u></a> [10].&#8221; It is a comprehensive analysis with many thoughtful, ambitious recommendations for updating regional and global institutions to accommodate China&#8217;s rise. But Rudd may be overestimating the degree to which there is a commonality of interests and underestimating nationalist pathologies in the both United States and China. It is difficult to envision developing joint positions on a panoply of issues from an East Asian security system to human rights, and not least, building a functioning Asia-Pacific Community as he advocates.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a more pessimistic <a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001Yzw48hWOHfIIt42rrJU0ykLro7CDToCnbXsqRM3YTHyzsaOKykzUZv-9Yh1SxYMQoo5rdAjLA9jCunD8CByknOsTnHZO_0VvOyRKkj7w2HaFFg9jOEJkmILZ1aAUk_hzLtLRgOqninrU4tFEykjiu2lA8eChxWrBsSrI0VXvq4BocCY1YLAFtlTUPuFJ-dGVAHlJPBra50zvvK5q_BmNalhe280yk4wgjPPWBgHcrPqAFXyVHEx28w==&amp;c=e4FdTaKuA4e2834lyR9gs4og1f4YQLqbuPrEoMTtdHW9f5PJfq833g==&amp;ch=ZrfR0Jw8GHObRaQ7uSpKhSzRRS1O6A1j5BnBw88eWuVsAW_fIobnCQ=="><u>Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) report </u></a>[11]calls for a new grand strategy to counter-balance China, in effect, containment, starting from the premise that &#8220;the American effort to &#8216;integrate&#8217; China into the liberal international order has now generated new threats to U.S. primacy in Asia.&#8221; [as if U.S. policy, not China&#8217;s market reforms, were the driver]. As with Rudd&#8217;s report, the CFR report contains many sensible proposals, most building on current efforts to strengthen U.S. economic competitiveness, expand trade networks and security partnerships and intensify diplomacy with Beijing.</p>
<p>But given that China is the world&#8217;s largest creditor and trading nation and the largest trading partner of U.S. allies in the region, their recommendation of barring China from trade accords is preposterous and impractical-and reverses 200 years of U.S. support for open markets in Asia. Similarly, calls for a new technology control regime are unrealistic.</p>
<p>No Asian nation wants to be forced to choose between the United States and China, as the CFR report points out. But it then advocates policies that would do exactly that. And we saw in the AIIB episode that on economic issues, countries will not choose to exclude China. The CFR report sees fundamentally conflicting U.S. and Chinese strategies and seeks a stronger balance against China to maintain American primacy. The report either doesn&#8217;t accept or fails to address the question facing the United States: what larger Chinese role in the region and globally can America accept?</p>
<p>Regardless of which assessment is correct, there appears a growing view that the current U.S.-China relationship, one partly cooperative and partly competitive may not be sustainable. Whether Washington and Beijing can find pathways that tilt the relationship more toward the cooperative than the competitive elements of the relationship is really part of a larger challenge facing the United States: how to accommodate U.S. interests to a transforming world in a static international system but an increasingly polycentric world where power is diffused.  But as we enter Silly Season, with 19 Republican candidates and counting, don&#8217;t hold your breath.</p>

</div>
<p id="story-continues-1" class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="370" data-total-count="370">The slogan for the 2008 Beijing Olympics was “Beijing Welcomes You.” Now, seven years later, a draft law targeting foreign institutions — including universities, museums, athletic and cultural groups, professional associations and all nonprofit social organizations established outside of mainland <a class="meta-loc" title="More news and information about China." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/china/index.html?inline=nyt-geo">China</a> — makes clear that Beijing has become much less welcoming.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="375" data-total-count="745">The draft “Foreign NGO Management Law,” released last month, is part of a package of legislation that includes strict laws on national security and antiterrorism. With this slate of broad and far-reaching statutes, President Xi Jinping, who evidently feels Communist Party rule is vulnerable to ideas from the outside world, is aiming to be the toughest leader since Mao.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="205" data-total-count="950">If the NGO draft becomes law, the international cultural, educational and technical exchanges that have become commonplace and so essential to China’s astonishing development may come to a grinding halt.</p>
<p id="story-continues-2" class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="375" data-total-count="1325">Under the proposal, foreign-based nonprofit organizations would need to be vetted by China’s security police before they conduct activities in China. The law does not define “activity,” so security agencies will have free rein to decide whether to put a stop to an organization’s plans in China — and there is no provision for independent review of their decisions.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="293" data-total-count="1618">The roots of the draft law go back at least two years to when the Communist Party circulated an internal memorandum titled <a href="http://www.chinafile.com/document-9-chinafile-translation">“Document No. 9,”</a> warning of the dangers of Western values and advising cadres to be vigilant against seven particular ideas, known as the “seven unmentionables.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="426" data-total-count="2044">The list of unmentionables displays a mistrust of outside influences that starkly contrasts with notions of a modern China building soft-power prestige around the world. Among the forbidden topics were: Western constitutional democracy, universal values, civil society, neoliberalism, Western media, “historical negation” and questioning the meaning of Chinese slogans such as “socialism with Chinese characteristics.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="427" data-total-count="2471">Document No. 9 further asserted that “Western anti-China forces and domestic ‘dissidents’ also incessantly carry out infiltration activities in our country’s ideological sphere, and challenge our mainstream ideology,” and that “Western embassies, media organs and nongovernmental organizations act within our borders under all kinds of names to spread Western values, and foster so-called anti-government forces.”</p>
<p id="story-continues-3" class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="412" data-total-count="2883">The draft law defines NGO expansively to cover any nongovernment, nonprofit “social organization” based outside of mainland China, including those in Hong Kong, Macao or Taiwan. Perhaps the law would only be selectively enforced against those organizations seen as credible threats to political security, but all covered organizations would operate under the constant threat of being shut down and penalized.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="418" data-total-count="3301">Even a single lecture by a Harvard professor, an art exhibit by New York’s Museum of Modern Art, an act of charity or humanitarian disaster relief by the Red Cross, an athletic competition, a performance by a high school marching band, or a scholarship offered to a Chinese student could fall under the purview of the law — so long as the event is carried out within China by, or on behalf of, a foreign nonprofit.</p>
<p id="story-continues-4" class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="359" data-total-count="3660">The registration process itself is cumbersome, and as a result many organizations will likely either forgo activities in China or get lost in a labyrinth of bureaucracy. Those that successfully register local representative offices, or get permits for temporary activities, will be subject to police searches of their offices, computers and financial records.</p>
<p id="story-continues-5" class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="464" data-total-count="4124">One of the most chilling parts of the draft, Article 59, extends to activities outside China’s borders. Any of the following vaguely defined actions, if attributed not only to a representative within China but also to a foreign organization abroad, would be a violation: subversion of state power, undermining ethnic harmony, spreading rumors, or “other situations that endanger state security or damage the national interest or society’s public interest.”</p>
<p id="story-continues-6" class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="239" data-total-count="4363">In other words, if a student group on an American campus protests against Chinese government treatment of Tibetans, the university could be barred from activities in China, and its representatives in China could be detained and prosecuted.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="308" data-total-count="4671">Outsiders do not yet know how rigid or broad the law’s enforcement would be, but it’s telling that enforcement would be carried out by the police, not by the Ministry of Civil Affairs, which regulates domestic organizations. The message is clear: Those seeking access to China must beware the party line.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="383" data-total-count="5054">Beijing has previously retaliated against governments that met with the Dalai Lama or that permitted the awarding of prizes to advocates of political reform in China. It has blocked news outlets, restricted electronic communications and denied entry and work visas to journalists based upon the content of their reporting. Now attention is turning to foreign nonprofit organizations.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="347" data-total-count="5401">The role of foreign engagement in aiding China’s economic and social progress over the past 35 years is unquestionable. It was the post-Cultural Revolution policy of reform and opening up, championed by Deng Xiaoping, that paved the way for China’s achievements through greater integration with the world economically, socially and culturally.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="459" data-total-count="5860">There is still time for China’s leaders to revise this draft. The National People’s Congress has invited public comment on the proposal. If the draft only reflects the views of a faction within the party, as many believe, responses from the public, including foreigners, could be influential. Those people who wish to see China continue on its path of peaceful engagement should come forward and be heard. The comment period for the draft law ends June 4.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="381" data-total-count="6241">The drafters of this law do not understand how China has benefited from its opening up. All they see are sinister “foreign agents” instigating change. It would be a mistake for China, and unfortunate for the rest of the world, if its leadership caves in to its most radical elements and tells the world that, while foreign investment is welcome in China, foreign ideas are not.</p>
